# Improve communication

**Goal: minimize distractions.**

* Batch messages: send a single large message with bulleted list instead of multiple small messages.
* Don't send confirmations ("OK", "Yes", :thumbsup:, :ok_hand:).
* Send direct messages instead of group messages for personal questions.
* Send location instead of name of the place.
* Call if urgent.
